# Worklog for Week 18 (01/05/2024 - 05/05/2024)

### Date: 01/05/2024

**Task**: Test field validations for the Credit Notes model
**Time Spent**: 2.5h
**Objective**: Test that that the Credit Notes model does what it needs to do.
**Achievements**:
- Wrote a test to make sure that no credit notes could be added with the same Credit Notes ID.
- 

**What did I learn?**:
- In Python: when using the syntax 'dictionary["key"] = value' 
    -> Python checks first if "key" exists in the dictionary.
    -> If the key exists, then its value will be updated.
    -> If "key" does not exist yet in the dictionary, the key will be added with the      specifified value. 
- In Django: if a model is dependent on another model through a foreign key relationship
    -> You can use an instance of that model stored in a variable to directly assign it as the foreign key for the model that is dependent on it.
    -> test_credit_note_data['D_ID'] = dealer

**Blockers**:
- Had to set up venv, Git, .env, .gitignore etc. on new laptop.
