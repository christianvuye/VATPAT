# Test Driven Development with AI (TDD-AI) Framework

## Overview
The TDD-AI Framework integrates traditional TDD principles with AI-driven techniques, focusing on enhancing software development through rigorous testing and AI collaboration.

## Process Steps with Examples

### 1. Set the Goal
**Description**: Define the functionality of the code in terms of input and output, focusing on API and argument structures.
**Example**: Develop a function to generate a monthly Credit Notes Resume for a dealer.
- **Input**: Dealer ID, Month (year and month)
- **Output**: List of Credit Notes

### 2. Formulate the Abstract Type
**Description**: Specify function signatures with type hints in a strongly typed language, aiming for pure functions.
**Example**:
```python
from typing import List
from datetime import date

def generate_credit_notes_resume(dealer_id: str, month: date) -> List[CreditNote]:
    pass
```

### 3. Construct Mock Functionality
**Description**: Create a basic mock function based on the abstract type without a full implementation.
**Example**:
```python
def mock_generate_credit_notes_resume(dealer_id: str, month: date) -> List[CreditNote]:
    return [CreditNote(id=1, issue_date=month, amount=1000)]
```

### 4. Write a Description for the Code
**Description**: Function queries the database for credit notes issued to the given dealer ID in the specified month.
**Example**: The function should query the database for credit notes issued to the given dealer ID in the specified month and return a list of these credit notes.

### 5. Generate Test Cases with AI
**Description**: Use AI to generate initial test cases based on the function specifications and descriptions.
**Example**:
```python
class TestGenerateCreditNotesResume(TestCase):
    def test_generate_for_valid_dealer(self):
        dealer_id = "dealer123"
        month = date(2023, 4, 1)
        result = generate_credit_notes_resume(dealer_id, month)
        self.assertIsInstance(result, list)
        self.assertTrue(all(isinstance(note, CreditNote) for note in result))
```

### 6. Review and Critique Test Cases
**Description**: Manually review AI-generated test cases and refine them to ensure comprehensiveness.
**Example**: Ensure tests cover scenarios such as invalid dealer IDs, months without credit notes, etc.

### 7. Implement Test Doubles and Triangulation
**Description**: Apply test doubles for external dependencies and use triangulation to refine AI suggestions for project suitability.
**Example**:
```python
class FakeDatabase:
    @staticmethod
    def get_credit_notes(dealer_id, month):
        return [CreditNote(id=2, issue_date=month, amount=2000)] if dealer_id == "dealer123" else []
```

### 8. Run Tests and Expect Failure
**Description**: Test the initial implementation, expecting failures to validate the test cases.
**Example**: Run initial tests with the mock function, expecting them to fail.

### 9. Create a Concrete Implementation
**Description**: Write code to fulfill the refined test requirements, focusing on passing all tests.
**Example**:
```python
def generate_credit_notes_resume(dealer_id: str, month: date) -> List[CreditNote]:
    return FakeDatabase.get_credit_notes(dealer_id, month)
```

### 10. Run Tests and Expect Success
**Description**: Re-run the tests with the aim of achieving success in all cases.
**Example**: Execute tests after implementing the function to ensure all pass.

### 11. Refactor and Iterative Review
**Description**: Continuously improve the code for quality and performance, adjusting based on AI suggestions.
**Example**: Review and enhance the implementation for readability, performance, and Django best practices.

### 12. Incorporate Performance Testing
**Description**: After successful implementation, integrate performance tests to validate the application's efficiency and responsiveness.
**Example**: Add performance tests to check the function's efficiency under large data volumes.

### 13. Code Review
**Description**: Conduct automated code reviews using tools like Codacy.
**Example**: Use Codacy for automated review of the newly implemented function for style issues, potential bugs, etc.

### 14. CI/CD
**Description**: Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment to automate integration of changes and streamline deployment.
**Example**: Integrate the function into the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Conclusion
The TDD-AI Framework represents a forward-thinking approach to software development, ensuring high-quality, reliable software outcomes by blending TDD's robustness with AI's dynamic capabilities.
